# Masters Thesis code


Code used in creating figures and simulation of results for the masters thesis can be found here.

Much of the main simulation code used to generate NK landscapes and update networks of agents and their learning has been adapted from Hills (2024) and Barkoczi & Galesic (2016):

### Some notes on the simulation runs

WARNING: The simulation times are very long.

DISCLAIMER: Some of the K-complexity landscapes in the main study were run in batches or separately to optimise computational load and runtime. This means that if the below code is run in its entirety in a single loop, the final performane values might vary slightly from those depicted in the study. However, this should not affect the overall patterns observed in the study.
